SKUL   (497) - This is a DANGEROUS file!!! It will overwrite over 8000
               sectors of drive C on the 20th of any month!!! DO NOT RUN!
               I do not normally write destructive code but did in this
               case so folks might take this more seriously. Hides itself
               from TYPE but does not define any keys.

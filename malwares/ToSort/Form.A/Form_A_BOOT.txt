Description: 
Form is a virus with viral code that is two sectors in length. Form reserves 2K of memory by modifying the available memory word at 40:13. Thus, on a 640K machine, MEM would report 638K and CHKDSK would report 653,312 bytes of free memory. On the hard drive, the second virus sector and the original boot sector are stored on the last two sectors of the infected drive. The virus does not protect these sectors, so they can be overwritten by data at a later time, making the drive hang during the boot sequence. The drive, however, will still be accessible. 

On a floppy disk, the virus stores its second sector and the original boot in an unused cluster and marks the cluster as bad in the FAT to protect it. CHKDSK reports 1024 bytes (1K) in bad sectors on an infected floppy disk. Upon booting from an infected disk, the virus checks the date using interrupt 1Ah function 4. The virus checks the value in the dl register for 18. This return is in binary-coded decimal, not hexadecimal , so the virus is testing for the 18th of the month, not the 24th. Some sources mistakenly have the 24th as the trigger date. 

On the 18th of every month, the virus produces a clicking sound whenever a key is pressed. 

The second virus sector contains the text: 


The FORM-Virus sends greetings to everyone whos reading this text. FORM doesnt destroy data! Dont panic! 
It also includes a short, obscene message to someone named Corinne. The message is not displayed, but can be seen by examining the next to last sector on the hard drive partition or the first sector in the bad cluster on a floppy disk with a disk editor. 

While the Form virus contains no intentionally damaging code, two bugs in the virus may cause problems. First, the virus does not retry disk reads and hangs the system on a failed disk read. Second, the unprotected second sector and original DOS boot sector on the hard disk may be overwritten if the drive fills completely, rendering the drive unbootable.

TYPE: Resident Stealth Boot sectors  
ORIGIN: Pakistan 

This is the oldest PC virus known, first detected in January '86. Several variants of this virus are known, but most of them are fairly harmless. This virus is rather large and most of it is located in sectors that are marked as "bad" in the FAT. 

Before this virus infects diskettes, it looks for a "signature". This makes it possible to "inoculate" against it, just by putting the signature in the correct place in the boot sector. 

The Brain virus tries to hide from detection by hooking into INT 13. When an attempt is made to read an infected boot sector, Brain will just show you the original boot sector instead. This means that if you look at the boot sector using DEBUG or any similar program, everything will look normal, if the virus is active in memory. This means the virus is the first "stealth" virus as well. 

The major effect of this virus is a (fairly harmless) change of the volume label. It usually becomes 


                        (c) Brain

but one variant of the virus changes the text into

One of the most interesting details regarding the Brain virus is the following text, which appears inside it:

In another version of the virus, the text looks like this:

These messages have led to considerable speculation regarding the possible author(s) of the virus. 

One harmful variant has been reported, which will attack on May 5. 1992. 

Nowadays Brain is extinct.

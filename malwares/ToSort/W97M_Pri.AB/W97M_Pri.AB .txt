The first Office 2000 native macro virus. 

I modified W97M/PSD by ALT-F11 and created W2000/PSD. So this first Word 2000 virus is a "class" virus with VAMP poly! 

The code is pretty much the same as W97M/PSD - a few changes have been made for stealth and disabling Word's macro virus protection but not too much work was needed. 

The bad news, Word 2000 has 3 levels of macro virus protection and installs with the highest security (level 3) ... which ignores ALL macro code - it doesn't even give a macro warning. It just plain has no macro functionality at level 3. I imagine this will really cut down on macro viruses in the wild. Did Microsoft finally implement real protection this time around? Only time will tell. 

Keep in mind the virus DOES NOT work correctly in Word 97.

Description: 
NYB is a simple virus that infects master boot records (MBRs) and DOS boot sectors (DBSs). NYB spreads to a system only when there is an attempt to boot the system from an infected floppy disk. 

During the boot process, NYB loads the MBR into memory and checks for infection. After determining that the MBR is not infected, the NYB stores the non-infected MBR at cylinder 0, side 0, sector 17 on the hard disk. NYB then places it’s virus code into the MBR and writes the infected MBR back to the hard drive at cylinder 0, side 0, sector 1. 

Once the boot process is complete and the NYB virus is active in memory, the virus displays its stealthing capabilities by redirecting any disk reads of the infected MBR or DBS to their clean counterpart. (On floppy disks, the original DBS is stored in the last sector of the root directory.) 

NYB is highly prolific.

POT    (685) - Infects one batch per run. If it can't infect anything
               it drops two ANSI bombs (space bar flashes a message and
               the ` key runs the root copy of the virus) and checks for
               '00' anywhere in the current time. If so it displays a
               silly message, giving itself away.

III. Description

	This tool is designed to clean a system that was infected by
PE_NIMDA.A.

	This tool will clean the system without having to boot using the
boot disk or emergency rescue disk.

	When FIX_NIMDA.EXE is executed, it will perform the following steps:
		o Terminate PE_NIMDA.A in memory.
		o Remove traces of PE_NIMDA.A in SYSTEM.INI file.
		o Scan all files on all fixed drives for infected executable and
			EML files.
		o Clean all infected files and delete all non-cleanable files.

			SLIDE.EXE.


IV. Requirements

	This tool is designed to run under Windows NT/2K and Windows 9X/ME.
	For this tool to execute properly under Windows NT/2000 it needs the
	following DLL files:
		o PSAPI.DLL
	Be sure that these two files are present in the "Winnt\system32" directory.


V. Notes

    1.  There are instances where the original mother file gets infected with
	PE_NIMDA.A thereby detection would be PE_NIMDA.A.  The file gets cleaned
	and another scan of the file reveals that it is the non-cleanable original
	mother file which FIX_NIMDA.EXE will delete.

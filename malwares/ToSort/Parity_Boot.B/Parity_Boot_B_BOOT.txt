Description:
The Parity Boot.B virus is a memory resident virus. It runs constantly in the background and can infect other diskettes as you use them. It will hide or "stealth" itself from anti-virus products. The Parity Boot.B virus has been found "in the wild" (i.e. outside of labs). Like most viruses, the Parity Boot.B virus does not contain a destructive payload. The Parity Boot.B virus does not employ encryption. It is a boot record virus. This virus can not spread through intranets, the Internet, or other e-mail. The Parity Boot.B virus infects your hard drive if you boot off an infected floppy diskette. Infected floppy diskettes or hard drives can be repaired in most cases.

Additional Comments:
The virus checks to see if it has infected a diskette every hour. If it has not infected a diskette in that time, it prints the message "PARITY CHECK" to the screen and hangs the computer. This virus can survive a warm boot.

When run, it installs a joke program resident in memory if not already
present. The virus code is inserted before the host batch. Infects one
file per run (or loop of the host) in the current and parent directory.
The payload isn't my code but the Guru said 'keep it'. When it's
resident, letters drop whenever Caps Lock is turned on.

Description: 
W97M.Pri is a polymorphic macro virus. This virus does not add a new VBA module. Instead, it adds its viral code to the "ThisDocument" VBA module. 

This macro virus infects MS Word 97 global template (NORMAL.DOT) when opening an infected document. It then infects other documents while closing the documents.

To hide its infection activity, it disables the following options:

Prompt to save Normal template 
Confirm conversion at Open

The first report of this macro virus from the field came to Symantec AntiVirus Research Center on January 14, 1999 through Norton Anti-Virus Scan-and-Deliver system.

Payload:

When the current minute matches the current date (for example, every 5th minute of the hour on the 5th day of the month), this macro virus adds up to 70 randomly colored and shaped AutoShape objects.

The MS Word 2000 variant:

This macro virus has a modified variant that works under MS Word 2000. This modified variant has not been seen in the wild. This particular variant has been modified to set MS Word 2000 security level to "low" when an infected document is opened. At low security level setting, MS Word 2000 will not warn the presence of macro in document.

Repair Notes:

The options and menu-commands that were altered by the virus can be restored by deleting the NORMAL.DOT file. Word will automatically create a new NORMAL.DOT file when it is launched.

Norton AntiVirus users can protect themselves from this virus by downloading the current virus definitions either through LiveUpdate or from the following webpage:

Class Macro Virus Generated By CPCK  
Demo For VAMP (Vic's Advanced Macro Poly)
written by VicodinES   

This demo is a full working CPCK Generated virus (with VAMP added to it)

The stand alone "plug-in" and full instructions for VAMP will be online shortly.

The poly is set to go off only when it infects the normal.dot class section - this way it
changes once per machine. If you want to run the VAMP engine from the VBE you can run the
middle sub (but only from the Active Document class section) it is not set to run in the 
Normal class section. 

I do suggest your run this from the VBE so you can get a feel for what the code does it's quite fun to watch.

peace

Vic

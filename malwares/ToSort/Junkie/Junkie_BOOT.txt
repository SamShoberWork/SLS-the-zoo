------------------------------------------------  

Description:
This virus is a memory resident virus. It runs constantly in the background and can infect other diskettes as you use them. The Junkie virus virus does not hide itself using "stealthing" techniques. The Junkie virus has been found "in the wild" (i.e. outside of labs). Like most viruses, the Junkie virus does not contain a destructive payload. This virus is an encrypted virus. Each time it infects new hard drives or diskettes, it encrypts itself in a slightly different fashion. This virus exhibits multipartite behavior and uses both files and disks (hard drives or floppy diskettes) to spread its infections. Because this virus infects files, it can spread over the modem or any networks. This virus infects floppy diskettes or hard drives in a manner that makes disinfection impossible.

Additional Comments:
Contains the encrypted messages "Sweden 1994" and "The Junkie Virus - Written in Malmo". The virus contains no intentionally damaging code, but will corrupt .COM files over 64k. It disables the antivirus included with MS-DOS 6.
